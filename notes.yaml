ref:
   t0 M229:
      The fiber moves rigidly to the right and up slightly, this is the
      "leeway" at the root. Once this leeway is exhausted the fiber starts to
      oscillate in uniform (no propogating waves). Then the substrate detaches
      pulling the fiber up off the bottom substrate to its maximum height, then
      the fiber readjusts the the bottom substrate with propogating waves.
   t8 M220:
      Story is qualitatively the same. Waves seem different. Less spikey, small
      amplitude intermediate waves. |..|..| instead of | | | |
   t24 M212:
   t44:
   t76:
      Same idea, move up and to the right, first. Then oscillate everything
      together as the substrate moves to the right, waves have a smaller
      amplitude. Prior to detaching there are propogating waves as well
   t88 M471:
      There are no waves in the detachment, the fiber moves up and to the right,
      the substrate detaches, and it relaxes back down to roughly its same
      position. This implies there is a span of angles were either the wave mode
      changes or immediately changes (at least within 8 degrees) So it would
      seem twitchy as is.
   t132:
      The same kind of wave behavior except the particles move to the left
      instead of to the right. The waves are modulated. (Particle still go up)
   t160:
      Same idea as 132, the modulated waves are "more modulated" i.e. longer
      full periods
   t180:
      Same story; different waves

eb0.1:
   t0:
      some crazy propogating waves...

varying bending:
   right local minimas magnitude is lower as beta increases
   left local minima magnitude is higher as beta increases
   More asymetric with large beta
   The peak maximum reduces with increasing beta

varying gamma:
   local minimums are swapped. (right is lower in ref, higher in 1000 gamma)
   maximum is reduced (not signficant)

varying eps top / bottom + fiber:
   decrease in magnitude of both top and bottom reduce the magnitude required
   for all cases by an equivalent order of magnitude (linear dependence?)

   with e = 1 and et = .1 eb = .1 the asymmetry is stronger betweeen minimums,
   with e = .1 the symmetry is stronger

   The reduction in magnitude isnt totally absolute. Its close, but a little
   bit extra is lost in the reduced eps

varying eps top (to 10):
   all magnitudes have increased, the symmetry is more pronounced at minimums

   strange shape changes as you approach the maximum (?)

using pressure:
   the general shape is similar but the edge cases are a lot different (flatten)
   the minimum magnitudes are signfianctly less, (~an order of magnitude)
   at low pressure there is low symmetry, right minimum requires more magnitude
   than left. With pressure increase the symmetry gets closer and both magnitudes
   increase for each minimum

varying eps bottom (.1, .01, 0):
   The changes are pretty dramatic as we reduce eps bottom, doesnt seem to be
   any obvious motifs. However the eb0.1 case does have the isolated pulloff

   et10 and eb0.1 are similar in the shape
