ref:
   1. l5 l10:
      Completely flat, the entirely black region (as expected)
   2. l14 m10:
      Moving from the black region towards the white region, (nearer the top)
      we get one small fold
   3. l15.5 m6:
      Moving further into the white area (still nearer the top) we get more
      smaller folds (2 folds this time)
   4. l19 m0.5:
      Into the white entirely, near the top, many folds on top of each other

   5. l9.6 m4.2:
      The grey region like 2. and 3. except closer to smaller magnitudes
      there are two folds
   6. l5.9 m0.1:
      In the white region near the bottom like 4. two folds that are nice and
      cyclic.

   7. l17 m11:
      Special case of the black region near the top, one large loop.

   1. -> 2. -> 3. -> 4.:
      moving from teh black region to the white reigon one step at a time near
      the top

   5. -> 6.:
      Moving from black to white near the bottom instead (really just grey 5.)
      and white (6.) regions

b100:
   The sections are similar to ref. Black is the exact same. Grey regions are
   similiar except the loops are stronger as you might expect.
   1. l14 m1.5:
      Good example of a grey region
   2. l19 m0:
      is like ref 6. (white region near the top)
   3. l4.6 m0.65:
      is like ref 7. (black line near the bottom)

b1000:
   1. l14 m5:
      nice example
   2. l20 m0:
      the white region

eb0.1:
   1. l14 m7:
      Similar to ref 2. (one short loop, use it as an example)
   2. l16 m0:
      (dont use) Similar to other directly pushing down in all cases.
   3. l20.5 m3.5:
      Use as an example, nifty little thing
   4. l6.25 m0.5:
      (dont use) Long folds over top each other like ref 5.
