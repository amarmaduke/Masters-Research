# Observations
## Four Modes
* Bottom Right, white, standing up, closer to black more of a lean
* Pure black, totally flat, crystalized and fully adhered
* Greying, folding onto itself, more and more folds further you go left
* Left edge, crystalization.

# Mappings (data.json sindex -> json seed filename)
* 0 -> (beta = 0.5, epislon bottom = 10)
* 1 -> (beta = 0.5, epislon bottom = 6)
* 2 -> (beta = 10, epislon bottom = 1)
* 3 -> (beta = 10, epislon bottom = 3)
* 4 -> (beta = 1, epislon bottom = 6)
* 5 -> (beta = 2, epislon bottom = 6)
* 6 -> (beta = 5, epislon bottom = 3)
* 7 -> (beta = 0.1, epsilon bottom = 3)
* 8 -> (beta = 0.1, epsilon bottom = 0.5)
* 9 -> (beta = 0.2, epsilon bottom = 3)
* 10 -> (beta = 0.2, epsilon bottom = 9)


# Descriptions (sindex -> description)
* 0 -> collapsed, folded over more than once (5 folds)
* 1 -> collapsed, folded over more than once. (4 folds)
* 2 -> erect fiber, no slant
* 3 -> slanted fiber, not collapsed
* 4 -> collapsed, folded over more than once (3 folds)
* 5 -> collapsed, folded over once
* 6 -> collapsed, with no folds
* 7 -> crystal, stack of hexagons, slanted
* 8 -> crystal, stack of hexagons, not slanted
* 9 -> crystal, elongation of the hexgaons (different from 10, no good reason)
* 10 -> crystal, elongation of the hexagons (different from 9, no good reason)
